#include <stdio.h>
// Stdio.h is a header file and C compiler knows the location of that file. 
// #include is a preprocessor.

// all code starts at the main() function where inside the curly braces contains the body of the function.
// It is very mandatory in every C program

int main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	// We have used printf() function which displays the text inside the quotation marks 

	return 0;
	// this is not mandatory but it is good practise and ends the program
}
